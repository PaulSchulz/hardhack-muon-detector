The Hardhack Muon Detector project has created a muon detector kit based on a
coincidence detection circuit using twin Geiger–Müller tubes.

The output is a 3.3V pulse, between 2.6 to 8 uS. A regular ESP based
microcontroller board can be used to count or perform some other action when
registering a pulse.

This repository contains code for ESPHome to program a Heltec Wireless Stick Lite V3
for connecting this sensor to the rest of the IoT world.

* Interface Board Examples

** Heltec Wireless Stick Lite V3, using ESPHome

The Heltec Wireless Stick Lite V3 is based on the esp32-s3 microprocessor which
includes Wireless and Bluetooth. The board also contains a LoRa transceiver for
communication outside of Wifi range.

*** Files
- esphome/esp32s3-muon-detector-led.yaml :: Configuration file and program for
  the muon detector. This version supports external LED strip light (WS2812
  based).
  
- esphome/esp32s3-muon-detector-v2.yaml :: Configuration file and program for
  the muon detector with support for dual input channels (GPIO1, GPIO2) for
  separate measurement of muon and background counts. 

- esphome/secrets.yaml :: Contains Wifi, API, Over the Air (OTA) update details.
  Edit these to what you are using.

This build requires that the ESPHome build system is installed and available.
